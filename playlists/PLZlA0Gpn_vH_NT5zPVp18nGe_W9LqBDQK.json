In this video I will be breaking down exactly how to setup infinite scrolling and why it is much easier than it appears. Infinite scrolling is really just a fancy type of pagination that will paginate without the user needing to click a button. This means that we can setup simple pagination, but instead of hooking it up to a button we need to hook it up to scrolling. Setting up a JavaScript event on scroll is not very performant, though, so we will be using the amazing InteresectionObserver API to efficiently check for when the last element of our list is loaded.\n\n\n🚨 IMPORTANT:\n\nIf you want to learn React in depth checkout my full modern React course.\nhttps://courses.webdevsimplified.com/learn-react-today\n\n\n📚 Materials/References:\n\nGitHub Code: https://github.com/WebDevSimplified/React-Infinite-Scrolling\n\n\n🧠 Concepts Covered:\n\n- How to use React hooks\n- useEffect, useState, useRef, useCallback hooks\n- IntersectionObserver with React\n\n\n🌎 Find Me Here:\n\nMy Courses: https://courses.webdevsimplified.com\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/WebDevSimplified\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/DevSimplified\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/7StTjnR\nGitHub: https://github.com/WebDevSimplified\nCodePen: https://codepen.io/WebDevSimplified\n\n\n#React #WDS #InfiniteScrolling",

      "description": "🚨 IMPORTANT:\n\nFull React Course: https://courses.webdevsimplified.com/learn-react-today\n\nReact is a complex library to use and the fact that everything is nested inside a component can make certain tasks much more difficult. One of those tasks is rendering popups and modals. It doesn't make sense for them to be rendered inside a component, but you need to access them inside a component. This would lead to a impossible problem to solve, but React thought of this for you. Portals are a way for you to render an element somewhere else while still having access to it in the component you are working on. They are a bit complex at first, though, so in this video I breakdown React portals step by step.\n\n\n📚 Materials/References:\n\nGitHub Code: https://github.com/WebDevSimplified/React-Modal-Popup\nReact Portal Blog Article: https://blog.webdevsimplified.com/2019-12/how-to-use-react-portal\n\n\n🧠 Concepts Covered:\n\n- How to use portals in React\n- How to create a modal in React\n- Portal best practices\n- How events are handled in portals\n\n\n🌎 Find Me Here:\n\nMy Blog: https://blog.webdevsimplified.com\nMy Courses: https://courses.webdevsimplified.com\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/WebDevSimplified\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/DevSimplified\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/7StTjnR\nGitHub: https://github.com/WebDevSimplified\nCodePen: https://codepen.io/WebDevSimplified\n\n\n#ReactPortal #WDS #ReactJs",
